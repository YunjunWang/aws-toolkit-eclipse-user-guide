**To validate an CloudFormation template in Eclipse**

* Perform either one of the following actions:

    *   Right-click the template name in the :guilabel:`Package Explorer` view and click
        :guilabel:`Validate` on the context menu.

        .. image:: images/tke-cfn-editor-validate-template-1.png
            :scale: 50%

    *   Right-click the template that you are editing in the editor pane and click
        :guilabel:`Validate` on the context menu.

        .. image:: images/tke-cfn-editor-validate-template-2.png
            :scale: 50%

.. important:: Your template will be validated for :emphasis:`JSON correctness` only; it will not be
   validated for :emphasis:`CloudFormation correctness`. A stack template validated in this way can
   still fail to launch or update.
