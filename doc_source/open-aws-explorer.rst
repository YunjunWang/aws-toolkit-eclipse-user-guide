##########################

To display |explorer|, click the AWS icon on the toolbar, and select :guilabel:`Show AWS Explorer
View`.

   AWS Icon Menu

.. note:: If the AWS icon is not visible on the toolbar, click the :guilabel:`Window` menu, and then
   click :guilabel:`Open Perspective | Other`. Click :guilabel:`AWS Management` from the list of
   Eclipse perspectives.

You can expand each node in |explorer| to view resources on AWS that are associated with your
account. For example, if you click the white triangle to the left of the :guilabel:`Amazon EC2`
node, it will expand and display |EC2| resources associated with your AWS account. The |tke| uses
the AWS account that you configured in the :doc:`setup-credentials` to determine which resources to
display.

If you select any of the subnodes to |EC2|, Eclipse will open a view with detailed information
about those resources. For example, double-clicking :guilabel:`Instances` opens a view that lists
information about each of your |EC2| instances such as its public DNS name, availability zone, and
launch time.
