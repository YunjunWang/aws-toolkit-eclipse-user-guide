Deploying a |CFN| Template in Eclipse

    :description: How to deploy an AWS Cloudformation template using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse.
    :keywords: cloudformation, template, deploying, stack


.. note:: Only files that end in :code:`.template` can be launched from the Eclipse IDE. If your
   file ends with another extension, such as :code:`.json`, you will need to rename it first with a
   :code:`.template` extension to use this feature.

**To deploy an CloudFormation template from Eclipse**

1.  With your |CFN| :code:`.template` file open in the |CFN| template editor (see
    :doc:`tke-cfn-editor-adding-template` for more information), right-click on the open template
    and select :guilabel:`Run on AWS`, then :guilabel:`Create Stack` on the context menu.

2.  In the :guilabel:`Create New CloudFormation Stack` dialog, enter your stack name in the
    :guilabel:`Stack Name` field. Your template file should be automatically chosen in the
    :guilabel:`Template File` field.

3.  Choose any (or none) of the following options:

    .. include:: tke-cfn-launch-options.txt

4.  Click :guilabel:`Next` to continue with entering parameter values.

5.  If your stack has parameters, you will enter values for them next. For parameters with a
    predefined list of possible responses, you can choose a value from the list provided.

6.  Click :guilabel:`Finish` to begin launching your stack.

While your stack is being launched, you can view its status by double-clicking the stack name
beneath the :guilabel:`CloudFormation` node in the :guilabel:`AWS Explorer` view, or by
right-clicking the stack name and selecting :guilabel:`Open in Stack Editor` on the context menu.

.. note:: If you cannot see the stack you launched in :guilabel:`AWS Explorer`, you may need to manually
    refresh the view by clicking the :guilabel:`Refresh AWS Explorer` icon at the top of the
    :guilabel:`AWS Explorer` view.
