Connecting to |RDSlong| (|RDS|)
###############################

In this section, we'll use the |tke| to connect to a database instance on the |RDSlong| (|RDS|).
Before stepping through the process described below, you will need to have an RDS database instance
associated with your AWS account. You can create a database instance on RDS using the |console|_.
When you create a database instance, set the TCP port that the database uses to receive connections
to a value that is accessible from your location. For example, if you are behind a firewall, choose
a TCP port to which your firewall allows connections. For more information, see the |RDS-ug|_.

#.  In :guilabel:`AWS Explorer`, expand the :guilabel:`Amazon RDS` node. You should see a list of
    the database instances that are associated with your AWS account. Right-click one of these
    instances, and then click :guilabel:`Connect` .

#.  The |tke| displays an authentication dialog box. Enter the master password that you specified
    when you created the database instance. Click :guilabel:`Finish`.

       Authenticate against the database instance

#.  The |tke| brings up the connection to the database instance in the Eclipse Data Source Explorer.
    From here, you can inspect the structure and data in the database.
