**To add a CloudFormation template to your Eclipse project**

1. Locate the template you'd like to add to your project in your system's file manager, and drag the
   file into your project's :guilabel:`Package Explorer` window.

.. note:: Files that end with :code:`.template` or :code:`.json` will automatically use the |CFN| template
    editor. If your file is not automatically recognized as an |CFN| template, you can select the
    editor by right-clicking the file name in :guilabel:`Package Explorer` or by right-clicking in
    the editor window with the file loaded, selecting :guilabel:`Open With`, then
    :guilabel:`CloudFormation Template Editor`
