New |LAMlong| Java Project Dialog
#################################

The :guilabel:`New Lambda Java Project` dialog helps you to create and configure a new Java project
that you can use to author a |LAM| function.


Launching the dialog
====================

The :guilabel:`New Lambda Java Project` dialog can be launched in the following ways:

*   by opening the AWS menu in the Eclipse toolbar and selecting :guilabel:`New AWS Lambda Java
    project...`.

*   by selecting :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`New` > :guilabel:`Other...` in the Eclipse menu, and
    then choosing :guilabel:`AWS` > :guilabel:`AWS Lambda Java Project` in the resulting dialog.


Create Project Dialog user interface
====================================

Project name
    :emphasis:`Required`. You must provide a name for your project.

Package name
    An optional name for your Java package. It must be a valid Java package name, such as
    "com.mycompany.myproject". When you enter the package name in the text entry field, it will be
    added to the contents of the :guilabel:`Source Preview` window.

    :emphasis:`Default`: None, this parameter is optional.

Class name
    :emphasis:`Required`. The name that identifies the Java class that contains your |LAM| code. It
    must be a valid Java class name. The default value is generic; you can specify your own name
    here or change the :guilabel:`Package name` to avoid conflicts with similarly-named classes.

    :emphasis:`Default`: :emphasis:`LambdaFunctionHandler`


Input type
    :emphasis:`Required`. The type of input that will be used to call your |LAM| function. You can
    select a category from the drop-down list:

    *   :emphasis:`S3 Event` |ndash| receives an event from `Amazon S3
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/walkthrough-s3-events-adminuser.html>`_ event.

    *   :emphasis:`SNS Event` |ndash| receives an event from `Amazon SNS
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-lambda.html>`_.

    *   :emphasis:`Kinesis Event` |ndash| receives an event from an `Amazon Kinesis stream
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/walkthrough-kinesis-events-adminuser.html>`_.

    *   :emphasis:`Cognito Event` |ndash| receives an event from `Amazon Cognito
        <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/devguide/sync/cognito-events/>`_.

    *   :emphasis:`Custom` |ndash| receives an event from custom code. If you set the input type to
        :emphasis:`Custom`, then you can also set the name of the custom input type in the box next
        to the type selection. By default, the generic :emphasis:`Object` type is used.

        .. important:: The custom input type :emphasis:`must` be a valid Java class name, and not a primitive
            type such as :code:`int`, :code:`float`, and so on. You can use Java's standard boxed
            types (:code:`Integer`, :code:`Float`, ...) for these cases.

        Use the :emphasis:`Custom` input type for setting up event sources such as the following:

        *   `user applications
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-custom-events.html>`_

        *   `mobile applications
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/wt-user-app-android.html>`_

        *   The `AWS Management Console
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-custom-events.html>`_.

        *   The `AWS CLI invoke command
            <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Invoke.html>`_.

    :emphasis:`Default`: :emphasis:`S3 Event`

Output type
    The output type. This must be a valid Java object.

    :emphasis:`Default`: :emphasis:`Object`
