Building an AWS Java Application
################################

In this section, we'll use the |tke| to build and run a local Java application that accesses AWS
resources.

The |tke| includes the |sdk-java| and a number of Java sample programs. The |tke| makes it easy to
build and run any of these samples. To demonstrate how the |tke| can help you build and run AWS
applications in Java, we'll use the :emphasis:`AmazonSimpleQueueService` sample as an example. The
AWS Explorer that is provided with the |tke| can be used to view the running |SQS| queue.

.. note:: The |sdk-java| samples are provided in the :file:`samples` directory in the SDK download,
   and can also be viewed on :github:`GitHub <aws/aws-sdk-java/tree/master/src/samples>`. For more
   information about the |sdk-java| itself, view the |sdk-java-dg|_.

Build and Run the |SQSlong| Sample
==================================

**To build and run the Amazon Simple Queue Service sample**

#.  Click the AWS icon on the Eclipse toolbar, and then click :guilabel:`New AWS Java Project`.

#.  In the dialog box that appears, type a name for the project in the :guilabel:`Project name` box
    and select :guilabel:`Amazon Simple Queue Service Sample`.

    .. image:: images/tke-aws-java-project.png

#.  Click :guilabel:`Finish`.

#.  The sample application appears in :guilabel:`Project Explorer`. Expand the tree view for this
    project.

#.  Beneath the :guilabel:`src` node, double-click the :file:`SimpleQueueService.java` source file
    to open it in the editor pane. Locate the following line:

    .. code-block:: java

        System.out.println("Receiving messages from MyQueue.\n");

#.  Right-click in the left margin of the editor pane, and select :guilabel:`Toggle Breakpoint`.

#.  Right-click the project node in :guilabel:`Project Explorer` |mdash| in our example, this would
    be the node named :userinput:`myJavaSqsApp` |mdash| then click :guilabel:`Debug As` >
    :guilabel:`Java Application`.

#.  In the :guilabel:`Select Java Application` dialog box, select the SQS application and then click
    :guilabel:`OK`.

#.  When the application stops at the breakpoint, Eclipse will ask if it should switch to the Debug
    perspective. Click :guilabel:`No` (the Debug perspective does not include AWS Explorer).

#.  Go to :guilabel:`AWS Explorer` and expand the :guilabel:`Amazon SQS` node.

#.  Double-click :guilabel:`MyQueue` and view the contents of the queue that was created by the Java
    client application.

    .. image:: images/tke-aws-explorer-sqs-queue.png

#.  Press :userinput:`F8`. The Java client application will continue running and terminate normally.

#.  Refresh the view in :guilabel:`AWS Explorer`. You will see that the :guilabel:`MyQueue` queue is
    no longer present; the application deletes the queue before the application exits.

.. note:: If you run this sample application repeatedly, you should wait at least 60 seconds between
    subsequent runs. |SQS| requires that at least 60 seconds elapse after deleting a queue before
    creating a queue with the same name.
