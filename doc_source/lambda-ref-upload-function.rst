Upload |LAMlong| Function Dialog
################################

The :guilabel:`Upload Lambda Function` dialog will create a |LAM| function and upload your code to
be run when the |LAM| function is invoked.


Launching the dialog
====================

The :guilabel:`Upload Lambda Function` dialog can be launched in the following ways:

* by opening the context menu for your AWS Lambda Java Project in Eclipse's :guilabel:`Project
  Explorer` view, and selecting :guilabel:`Amazon Web Services` > :guilabel:`Upload function to AWS
  Lambda...`.

* by opening the context menu in the code window for your Java class and selecting :guilabel:`AWS
  Lambda` > :guilabel:`Upload function to AWS Lambda...`.

The Upload Function dialog contains two screens:

* :ref:`Select Target Lambda Function <select-target-lambda-function-ui>`

* :ref:`Function Configuration <lambda-function-config-ui>`


.. _select-target-lambda-function-ui:

Select Target Lambda Function user interface
============================================

.. image:: images/lambda_target_function_filled.png

Select AWS Region
    :emphasis:`Required`. Select the region where your |LAM| function will be created.

    :emphasis:`Default`: the default |console| region for your AWS account.

Select or create a Lambda function
    :emphasis:`Required`. You must choose whether to use an existing |LAM| function from the
    drop-down list, or to create a new one by entering its name.

    :emphasis:`Default`: :guilabel:`Create a new Java function`

When you click :guilabel:`Finish`, control proceeds to the :guilabel:`Configure Function` screen.


.. _lambda-function-config-ui:

Configure Function user interface
=================================

.. image:: images/lambda_target_function_config_filled.png

The screen is divided into four sections, each with its own settings.

Basic Settings
--------------

This section shows the function name and allows you to add a text description.

Name
    :emphasis:`Immutable`. The name is determined by the name chosen during the :guilabel:`Select
    Target Lambda Function` screen. It can not be modified here, though you can click
    :guilabel:`Back` to re-enter it on the previous screen.

Description
    :emphasis:`Optional`. A text description of the function.

    :emphasis:`Default`: the description is empty.


Function Execution
------------------

This section allows you to modify the execution environment for the function.

Handler
    :emphasis:`Required`. The Java class that contains your |LAM| function code.

    :emphasis:`Default`: the package and class name from your project are automatically selected for
    you.

IAM Role
    :emphasis:`Required`. The role that Lambda will use to access your AWS resources during the
    execution of your function. You must make sure that this role provides access for |LAMlong| to
    at least |S3|, but if your function uses any other AWS resources, you must also provide access
    to each of the services used.

    :emphasis:`Default`: the first IAM role from your AWS account.


S3 Bucket for Function Code
---------------------------

This section allows you to set an S3 bucket used by your |LAM| function.

S3 Bucket
    :emphasis:`Required`. An |S3| bucket that can be used by your function's code. Only buckets that
    are in the same region that you will run the function in will be displayed here.


Advanced Settings
-----------------

This section contains settings that are less often used, they provide further control over your
function's execution environment than the settings in the :guilabel:`Function Execution` section.

Memory (MB)
    :emphasis:`Required`. The number of megabytes of memory available to your lambda function.

    :emphasis:`Default`: 512 MB

Timeout (s)
    :emphasis:`Required`. The timeout, in seconds, after which the function will be considered to
    have failed if it has finished execution.

    :emphasis:`Default`: 15 s.
