The following table describes the important changes since the last release of the |tke-ug|.

**API version:** 2010-12-01

**Last documentation update:** |today|

Dec 22, 2015
    Removed the *Additional Resources* topic |mdash| the information from that page is now available
    on the first page of the guide, under the heading :ref:`additional-resources`.

Oct 22, 2015
    * The guide has been renamed from "Getting Started Guide" to "User Guide", to better represent
      its function.

    * Installation instructions have been updated to compensate for changes in the way you select
      components of the toolkit to install.

June 16, 2014
    The |tke| now provides support for authoring |LAMlong| functions with Java. For more
    information, see :doc:`lambda`.

September 27, 2013
    * The |tke| now uses the same system for storing and accessing AWS credentials as the AWS CLI
      and AWS SDKs, which includes the ability to use multiple profiles to store more than one set
      of credentials. For information, see the newly-updated topic: :doc:`setup-credentials`.

    * The |tke| Getting Started Guide has been restructured in alignment with other AWS SDK
      Documentation (most notably, the AWS Java SDK upon which the |tke| depends). Much of the
      restructuring should be logical and self-evident, but a description of each of the guide's
      major sections is provided in :doc:`welcome`.

    * :doc:`getting-started` has been updated for Eclipse 4.3 ("Kepler").

September 9, 2013
    This topic tracks recent changes to the |tke-ug|. It is intended as a companion to the `release
    notes history <http://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/Eclipse/>`_.
